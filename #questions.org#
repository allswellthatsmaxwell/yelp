* Does a user visiting a place predict their friends will visit it in the future?
How long till the friends visit? How many friends will visit? Does the rating matter, 
or just the fact that the original person visited?
* How do reviews differ based on time of day?
Both time of review and peak hours of business. Do late-night places get shorter reviews?
Are there speech patterns to the people who frequent morning places?
* Let's try to model the holiday effects more aggressively
For the timeseries modeling on reviews per day.
The model is a little more hesitant about holiday dips than I'd like.
I feel like the dips in AZ in particular can be more aggressive. Let's
try adding in holidays to the model (can use just AZ for testing)
to see if that ups the aggression.
** Did so
It looks good! super spikes down around holidays in a few states, which reflects the actual behavior. 
We should make sure it's actually spiking down on the right days... but it looks promising. Keep
this change.
