# When do people post Yelp reviews?

```{r include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
NMIN_TO_COUNT <- 100
fmt_text_date <- function(dt) format(dt, "%B %d, %Y")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 30, fig.height = 18)
pdf_gg_facet_theme <- list(theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 30),
                                 axis.text = element_text(size = 26),
                                 axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),
                                 axis.title = element_text(size = 34),
                                 legend.text = element_text(size = 32),
                                 title = element_text(size = 42)))
```

The number of reviews posted to Yelp per day is a proxy to
a number of interesting questions. Is Yelp usage still growing? What days of
the week do people visit restaurants? Do people go out on holidays (or: are
restaurants open on holidays?)?

## Input Data
Input data is a subset of Yelp data. Data was provided for 11 metropolitan areas.
Dates range from `r fmt_text_date(min_date)` to
`r fmt_text_date(max_date)`. We examine trends at the state and province level
(from here-on just "states"). Input data contains reviews from
`r .number_of_states` states, but not all states saw enough Yelp activity to
say interesting things about; just
`r .count_n_above(.all_time_reviews_by_state, NMIN_TO_COUNT)`
had more than `r NMIN_TO_COUNT` reviews all-time. If this seems low, note that
the publicly-available data is only a small subset of Yelp's data, and than
some very small "states" are likely just incorrectly marked (e.g. state "01")

Part of our objective will be to forecast future review counts. So we'll
keep only those states that have a decent amount of activity in the recent past.
Specifically, we only analyze states with `r MIN_REVIEWS_IN_YEAR` or more
reviews in the year `r YEAR`.  These are:
```{r include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
.states_to_use_counts %>%
  xtable::xtable(align = "llr") %>%
  print(type = "latex", include.rownames = FALSE, comment = FALSE)
```

Going forward, we only use these states.

### Reviews Per Day
Reviews per day per state all-time activity.
Note that each y axis is different.

```{r include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, dpi = 70}
.daily_review_counts_plot + pdf_gg_facet_theme
```

Observe:
	
* There is an upward trend in most states.
  
    This makes sense -- Yelp was founded
    in 2004. More people learned of the site over time and so reviews grew over time.
    What's interesting is the states that *didn't* trend upward over the past 12 years:
    Baden-Wurttemburg in Germany, and the Edinburg region in Scotland. A few
    possible explanations:

    + Competition
    
        Yelp did have a serious European competitor: Qype. In May 2012, Qype 
        may have had as much as 5 times Yelp's traffic [@qype_traffic].
	Yelp bought Qype 5 months later [@qype_merger], and the beginning of an
	upward trend in Baden-Wurttemburg happens around the same time!
	But it doesn't continue.

* Large, infrequent spikes downward in reviews posted

    This is most obvious in Arizona, but is the case in many states, including
    the two Canadian provinces. These are probably the big winter holidays.

* Infrequent high outliers

    At least Illinois, Wisconsin, and Quebec have a few days with a very high
    number of reviews.

* South Carolina
    South Carolina's utilization looks odd, but there are very few reviews
    in the state.

\pagebreak
    
#### Outliers
There are outliers in the dataset. We'd like to know:

* Did the single dramatic spikes upward in the two European countries occur
  on the same day?

* Do the yearly dips in AZ, PA OH, WI, and more fall on Christmas, or
  Thanksgiving?

To answer these questions, any rough definition of outliers will do.
We just need a scheme that picks up the outliers obvious to the eye, 
and that doesn't pick up too many days.
We landed on taking those days that were 4 or more standard deviations from
the yearly-detrended mean. In other words: we removed the upward trend from
each state, then took the points that were unusually far away from the average.
Then graphically, the average is the horizontal white line and the
outliers are the red triangles:

```{r include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, dpi = 70}
.daily_review_counts_plot_w_outliers + pdf_gg_facet_theme +
    guides(color = FALSE, shape = FALSE)
```

##### Did a spike in usage occur in two European states at the same time?
	
The far-away view suggests that the Baden-Wurttemburg outlier spike
and the Edinburg spike may fall on the same days. But closer examination
is less exciting; below, we mark each outlier day with a black dot, and leave
non-outlier days blank. The spikes we are interested occur between 2008 and
2010, so only those years are included.

```{r include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, dpi = 70, fig.height = 1.2, fig.width = 5.7}
.european_outliers_plot + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
                                axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
                                axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12,
                                                           angle = 90))
```

Though the outlier  days sometimes overlap for the two regions,
the patterns are less similar than the red-triangled outlier plot suggested. So
there's not much here. Let's move on.  

\pagebreak
	
##### Are holidays causing the infrequent downward jumps in some states?

Given a holiday H, we consider H, the day before H, and the day after to be
the same holiday, and name them all H.
Then the counts of holidays that are also outlier days are as follows:
```{r include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
.outlier_holidays %>%
    xtable::xtable(align = "lrcl") %>%
    print(type = "latex", include.rownames = FALSE, comment = FALSE)
```

So Thanksgiving and Christmas do often correspond to the low days. This
is reasonable; people probably go to restaurants less on these big family-oriented
holidays. This also suggests we should include these holidays in any forecasting we do.  

There are some good strange cases here, too; Quebec's apparent celebration of
Independence Day is especially charming.

\pagebreak

#### Forecasting future reviews-per-day

Auto-fitting a timeseries model to each state using default settings
(and denying holidays any special treatment) gives the following fits 
to the data. We also include a forecast for one year past
the final data point:
    
```{r include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, dpi = 70}
.reviews_facets + pdf_gg_facet_theme
```  

The upward trends are captured nicely, and the within-year variation
also looks good. This fit can be used to predict, but also provides a clearer
picture of the different trends over time. The fitted line allows us
to observe:

* Almost all states have their highest yearly yelp review activity 
  in the middle of the year.

* Arizona exhibits a strange step-like behavior in its upward trend.

* The year-of-year acceleration in reviews has leveled off in the past
  few years: Nevada, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and especially Wisconsin and Ontario
  appear to perhaps be going level (though the increasing spread in the data
  in recent years in some states [esp. Ontario] complicates this conclusion).

\pagebreak

##### Marking holidays
We discovered in a previous section that a lot of outliers coincide with
holidays. Treating holidays specially may improve the forecast. Fitting the
same model as above, but including the holidays from the previous section,
results in the following in-sample fit (zoomed-in to 2017 for better resolution).
Holidays are marked with points (recall that we consider the 3-day area 
around a holiday to all be holidays).

```{r include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, dpi = 70}
.holiday_vs_non_forecast_plot + pdf_gg_facet_theme
```  

So marking holidays has induced the fit to dive and arc aggressively for
holidays on which there were extreme values; but at the same time, no
dives or arcs are made for days marked holidays that had values in
normal ranges. So our strategy of marking a slew of holidays, even ones that
do not commonly coincide with extreme values, did not hurt the model's ability
to discriminate between (in-sample) true extreme holidays and 
technically-holidays-but-pretty-normal days.

\pagebreak

##### Choosing a model

The in-sample twelve-year view suggests that our fits are smart
and reasonable. But so far we've only seen fits on in-sample data.
We now examine out-of-sample error. As before, we fit models with and without
holidays, but this time the models are trained only up to the end
of 2016. Then we forecast 2017.

```{r include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, dpi = 50}
.out_of_sample_year_plot + pdf_gg_facet_theme
```

So although the fits are reasonable, we also get a decent amount of
error day-to-day. We also see that, for all our holiday considerations
in previous sections, the model actually declines to dive and arc as it
did on the in-sample holidays, and the two models are almost identical!
So we go on to report accuracy measures on the with-marked-holidays model, but
we would do just as well with the holiday-agnostic model.

##### Accuracy
The average *daily* percentage error per state for this 365-day forecast
on 2017 is as follows:

```{r include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
.error_table %>%
    xtable::xtable(align = "lccc") %>%
    print(type = "latex", include.rownames = FALSE, comment = FALSE)
```

* The interpretation of Avg daily % error is:
  If we forecasted the reviews
  for every day in 2017 for, e.g., North Carolia, the forecasted value for
  a given day would be, on average, 14% off the mark.

* The interpretation of the sum-of-year percentage error is:
  If, at the end of 2016, we had forecasted the total-reviews-in-year
  for 2017 for, e.g., North Carolia, the forecasted year total would have been
  0.7% below the actual total.

Some states see impressive sum-of-year accuracies; others see impressive average
daily accuracy. Whether any state model is sufficiently accurate
must be considered in the context of what the important accuracy measure is.
